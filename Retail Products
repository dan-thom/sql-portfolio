# In this project, I've created a sqlite database for a local maker store that holds information
# about the store's products. First I created some tables to hold the data, then inserted data
# into each table. Finally, I ran some analytics with joins and aggregation.


# Creating the necessary tables
CREATE TABLE categories (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR
);

CREATE TABLE products ( 
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY , 
    name VARCHAR , 
    color VARCHAR , 
    description TEXT , 
    unit_price NUMERIC , 
    category_id INTEGER,
    CONSTRAINT fk_category
        FOREIGN KEY (category_id)
        REFERENCES categories(id)
);

# Inserting data into the tables (shortened for brevity)
INSERT INTO categories VALUES (0, "Printer Filament");
INSERT INTO products VALUES (0, "PLA+ 1kg", "Blue", "Our recycled PLA with strength-enhancers for additional durability...", 18.99, 0);

# Analysis
# Finding the average item price in each category
SELECT
    c.name AS "Category",
    ROUND(AVG(p.unit_price), 2) AS "Avg. Price"
FROM categories c
LEFT JOIN products p
    ON c.id = p.category_id
GROUP BY c.id

# Finding the number of products in each category
SELECT
    c.name AS "Category",
    COUNT(p.id) AS "Num. of Products"
FROM categories c
LEFT JOIN products p
    ON c.id = p.category_id
GROUP BY c.id
